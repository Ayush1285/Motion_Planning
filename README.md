# Quadcopter  Navigation
In this project, we aim to simulate motion planning for a quadcopter in cluttered environments
## Objectives
* Learning and implementation of planning algorithms (A*, RRT) in 2D grid
* Developing environment for Gazebo simulation.
* Mapping of environment using quadcopter.
* Generating path for a quadcopter by applying motion planning algorithms.
