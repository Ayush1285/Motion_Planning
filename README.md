# Autonomous_Quadcopter
In this project, we aim to develop Quadcopter system for autonomous navigation and control in obstacle cluttered environments
## Objectives
* Learning and implementation of planning algorithms (A*, RRT) to autonomously navigate between multiple waypoints in 2D space.
* Generating trajectories between multiple waypoints in 3D space using planning algorithms.
* Extending the implementation on a drone by planning collision-free dynamically feasible trajectories between obstacles.
* Estimating states of drone using sensors and GPS data and applying controls.
